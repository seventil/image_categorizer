# image_categorizer
I used to collect a lot of images as references for digital paintings and studies. One of the best 
ways that I found in studying images is comparing them using different attributes in mind.
It is also a great way to build up taste - compare two images, see what you like more, repeat many 
times - you'll build up strong preferences. Attributes may vary between people, but may be, for 
example: color, contrast, texture, etc. The more you get into it, the more sophisticated attributes 
you'll want to use.

Besides evaulation, you'll want categorize images with (maybe) different attributes
for each category. For example, one category is landscape with ratings on composition and color,
the other is anatomy with ratings on complexity. Some categories may be exclusive - that means
they'll get their separate folders. For example, ballet may be exlusive and include photographic,
anatomy nested categories.
